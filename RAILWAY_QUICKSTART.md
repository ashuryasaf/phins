# 🚀 Quick Railway Deployment Instructions

## Your Repository is Ready for Railway!

All changes have been committed. Now deploy to Railway:

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Visit:** <https://railway.app>

2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account

3. **Click:** "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"

4. **Select:** `ashuryasaf/phins`

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for automatic deployment

6. **Access your app:**
   - Railway will give you a URL like: `https://phins.up.railway.app`
   - Add `/admin-portal.html` to access admin portal
   - Login: `admin` / `admin123`

### Method 2: Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from repository
railway up

# Get your deployment URL
railway domain
```

### Method 3: Automated Script

```bash
./deploy_railway.sh
```

## After Deployment

### 1. Get Your URL

Railway assigns a URL automatically:
```
https://phins-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

### 2. Test It

Access the admin portal:
```
https://[your-url]/admin-portal.html
```

Login with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### 3. Add Custom Domain (Optional)

In Railway Dashboard:
1. Settings → Domains → Custom Domain
2. Enter: `www.phins.ai`
3. Add CNAME record to your DNS:
   - Name: `www`
   - Value: (provided by Railway)

## Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Test the API endpoint
curl https://[your-railway-url]/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Should return:
# {"token": "demo-token-admin-...", "role": "admin", "name": "Admin User"}
```
